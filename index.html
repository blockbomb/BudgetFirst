<p>Budget First is intended to be a budgeting application for a personal budget. It builds upon well established budgeting concepts such as envelope and zero-sum budgeting. 
We want to place privacy and options first, allowing you to adjust the behaviour and budgeting timeframe for your needs.
Cloud and (possibly) network synchronisation will be entirely optional.</p>

<p>The project was founded by <a href="https://github.com/urbanhusky" class="user-mention">@urbanhusky</a> after he was scared by the discontinuation of a budgeting software he relied on. 
The successor to that application was designed as a cloud/saas application, which did not meet his high requirements in privacy and availability. This project was founded to give the part of the community, that relied on standalone applications and control over their data, a way to continue their budget.</p>
