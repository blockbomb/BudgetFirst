{"name":"Budget First","tagline":"Budget First is a free, open source budget application with a focus on privacy","body":"### About\r\nBudget First is intended to be a budgeting application for a personal budget. It builds upon well established budgeting concepts such as envelope and zero-sum budgeting. \r\nWe want to place privacy and options first, allowing you to adjust the behaviour and budgeting timeframe for your needs.\r\nCloud and (possibly) network synchronisation will be entirely optional.\r\n\r\nThe project was founded by @urbanhusky after he was scared by the discontinuation of a budgeting software he relied on. \r\nThe successor to that application was designed as a cloud/saas application, which did not meet his high requirements in privacy and availability. This project was founded to give the part of the community, that relied on standalone applications and control over their data, a way to continue their budget.\r\n\r\n[View the original post that caused this project to be born.](http://forum.youneedabudget.com/discussion/comment/542417/#Comment_542417)\r\n\r\n### Project state\r\nWe're currently in the process of collecting requirements and debating technical questions, such as choice of frameworks, synchronisation mechanism etc.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWe're currently looking for contributors and are in the progress of setting up the necessary communication infrastructure.\r\nProject founder: @urbanhusky\r\n\r\n### Links\r\nWe're discussing requirements, project team and bouncing off various ideas on each other in our [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/budget-first).
